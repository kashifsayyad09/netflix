The AI engineer's work primarily focused on delivering a comprehensive, pixel-perfect frontend clone of Netflix using React and Shadcn UI components. The process involved a structured five-step development workflow: analysis, frontend-only implementation with mock data, web search/screenshot utilization, UI/UX replication, and mock data generation. The engineer first gathered information about Netflix's UI, then systematically created core components like , , , , , , , and . All data was mocked via . The engineer meticulously verified the UI/UX fidelity through multiple  invocations, confirming profile selection, hero banner, content rows, hover effects, navigation, and video player functionality. The current state is a fully functional frontend with mocked data, ready for backend integration upon user confirmation.

<product_requirements>
The primary product requirement was to build a clone of Netflix. The user implicitly requested a highly visual and interactive application, emphasizing replication of the original Netflix UI/UX. The AI engineer interpreted this as needing to replicate the multi-page UI, including pop-up modals and specific hover effects.

Key aspects of the replicated application include:
*   **Profile Selection:** A clean, Netflix-style profile selection page with hover effects.
*   **Hero Banner:** A featured content area (e.g., The Crown) with Play and More Info buttons.
*   **Content Rows:** Multiple scrollable categories like Trending Now, Popular on Netflix, Action Movies, and Watch It Again.
*   **Hover Effects:** Detailed overlays on content cards upon hover, showing more information.
*   **Navigation Header:** A complete Netflix-style header with the logo, navigation menu, search bar, and profile dropdown.
*   **Video Player:** An in-app YouTube viewer to play video trailers, embedded in a full-screen player.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout must work perfectly across devices, specifically verified for desktop.
*   **Real Content Feel:** Use high-quality movie/show images and trailers (via YouTube linking) to enhance realism, even with mocked data.

The current implementation has successfully delivered a visually identical frontend with all data mocked, and the UI is fully interactive as a frontend-only application.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed the frontend development of the Netflix clone, delivering a highly functional and visually accurate replica using mocked data. All key UI/UX elements, including profile selection, the hero banner, scrollable content rows with detailed hover effects, a functional navigation header, and an embedded YouTube video player, are implemented. The application mimics Netflix's design and feel, providing a compelling user experience even without a live backend.

Specifically, the following components are integrated and working:
*   A Profile Selection page allows users to pick a profile.
*   Upon selecting a profile, the user is directed to the HomePage.
*   The HomePage displays a dynamic Hero Banner with featured content (e.g., The Crown) and interactive Play and More Info buttons.
*   Multiple Content Rows (e.g., Trending Now, Popular on Netflix) are displayed, allowing horizontal scrolling through mock movie/show cards.
*   Hover Effects on content cards reveal a detailed overlay with additional information.
*   Clicking the Play button on a hero banner or content card opens a full-screen Video Player that embeds a YouTube video.
*   The Header provides navigation, search (UI ready), and a profile dropdown.

All content, including movie titles, descriptions, images, and video URLs, is sourced from . The  and  files were updated to establish the new routing and styling. The application is now in a state where backend development can commence to transition from mock data to real data fetched from a database.
